# 🧠 What Went Wrong: Me as a Coder

> *"A real coder doesn’t just solve problems — they document what broke, what they learned, and how to never break it again."*

Welcome to my personal coding journal. This repository is where I log daily reflections, mistakes, breakthroughs, and learnings as I continue to grow as a developer, automation builder, and reports analyst.

---

## 📓 Purpose

This journal is dedicated to:
- Documenting real-world coding challenges I face at work
- Reflecting on what went wrong — and how I fixed it
- Sharing practical solutions for Python, VBA, Excel, automation, and data analysis
- Tracking my continuous improvement through clear, dated entries

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Each journal entry is saved in Markdown (`.md`) format and named by date for easy tracking.

```
📁 /journal
   ├─ 2025-06-18-cdr-filtering-reflection.md
   ├─ 2025-06-19-report-automation-vba.md
   └─ ...
```

Every entry typically contains:
- 🛠️ Task  
- ⚠️ Challenge  
- ✅ Solution  
- 💡 Key Learnings  
- 🧠 Reflection  

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Topics I Work With
- Python (pandas, openpyxl, csv, logging)
- Excel automation via VBA
- Data consolidation & filtering
- KPI tracking and performance metrics
- File-based automation (CDR, report loaders)
- Git & GitHub for journaling and documentation

## 💡 Why This Matters

As a professional, I believe it's not enough to write working code.  
> It's more powerful to **understand what failed**, **learn from it**, and **improve your craft**.

This repo serves as my timeline of growth — from confusion to clarity, from frustration to solution.
